# VEX V5 PushBack AI demo

This subdirectory contains a V5 C++ project designed to showcase how the Jetson runs inference on game objects and sends detection data to the V5 Brain, which uses that data to play the game. 

This project contains a basic implementation to get you started and is designed to be ran on the 2025-26 Pushback HeroBot with a ball pre-loaded

When the program is ran, the robot will search for a blue ball and once found, will drive to it and intake it. The robot will then calculate which of the 4 ends of the long goals it is closest to, drive to that end, and score the ball.

#### Program Structure
- `main.cpp`- Entry point of the program. Configures devices, sets up the main callback and polls the Jetson for data
- `ai_functions.cpp` - Contains helper functions that allow the robot to navigate the field, and find and interact with objects
- `ai_jetson.cpp` - Code that handles receiving data from the Jetson over serial
- `ai_robot_link` - Code that handles robot-to-robot communications
- `dashboard.cpp` - Presents data and status information for Jetson and VEXLink communications on the Brain screen
